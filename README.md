# Brothel Connect V4
This is the entire website source code for the current version of brothelconnect.ml

This version of the brothel connect source is ready to be uploaded onto a webserver

The source is very some basic to moderate html with all styling done in the html documents insstead of having standalone .css files. There are also some java scripts inside the html files instead of having standalone .js files. 

This would be a good source to learn off if you are just getting into html and css as it is very basic and easy to understand.

This repo will be kept up to date with the site

The entire website is developed and hosted by Uncle Bill

Leaks could not be bundled with source due to file upload size on github
